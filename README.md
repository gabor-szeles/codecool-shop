We started development on this project using a small skeleton code. From the beginning, the goal was developing a onepager, so we relied heavily on Javascript/AJAX.
Since one of the tasks we've had was creating the persistence layer, we are using JDBC directly to manually connect to the background database, and for queries it. We also wrote the code manually for the  object-relational mapping, needed for the site to function.
The skeleton code only included the base look for the site, so all the Javascript is written by us as well.
